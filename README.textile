h1. Textile Specifications

These are the specifications for the Textile markup language. Each implementation (libraries for PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.) can use them to make sure it is compliant. If the implementation uses git, the specifications can be incorporated as a git submodule and parsed with a YAML library for your platform.
